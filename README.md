# IOT-Based-Biometric-Attendance-System
This project is a comprehensive solution for automating attendance management using biometric data. Leveraging an ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an R305 Fingerprint module, an LCD display, and the power of Google Sheets, this system simplifies attendance tracking and record-keeping.

Key Components and Features:

1. ESP8266 NodeMCU Integration: The heart of this system is the ESP8266 NodeMCU module, which acts as the bridge between the biometric data and the Google Sheets. It facilitates data collection and transfer, making the attendance system more accessible and manageable.

2. Biometric Data Collection: The project integrates an R305 Fingerprint module, enabling secure biometric data capture for attendance. This provides a reliable and efficient way to identify individuals.

3. LCD Display: An LCD display is incorporated for real-time feedback and interaction, allowing users to view important information and instructions related to the attendance process.

4. Google Sheets Integration: To store and manage attendance records, this system utilizes Google Sheets. This integration simplifies attendance tracking, and the Google Sheet acts as a central repository for attendance data, ensuring accessibility and data integrity.

5. Pushing Box API: The Pushing Box API plays a vital role in sending biometric data from the NodeMCU to Google Sheets. This API helps establish a connection between the hardware and the cloud-based Google Sheets, ensuring a seamless and automated data flow.
